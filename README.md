# Clustering and PCA Analysis

## Clustering (Digital Ads Data)
The project involves segmenting types of ads based on features like CPM, CPC, and CTR using clustering techniques. Here's a summary of the steps:

1. Basic data analysis: Explore the data, handle missing values using predefined formulas, and check for outliers.
2. Outlier treatment: Decide whether outlier treatment is necessary for K-Means clustering based on judgment.
3. Z-score scaling: Perform z-score scaling and discuss its impact on algorithm speed.
4. Clustering:
   - Hierarchical clustering using Ward linkage and Euclidean distance.
   - Elbow plot and silhouette scores analysis to identify the optimum number of clusters.
   - Profile ads based on the optimal number of clusters using domain understanding.
5. Conclusion: Summarize learnings and insights gained from the clustering analysis.

## PCA ( Census Abstract)
The task involves performing detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on census data and identifying the optimum Principal Components using Sklearn. Here's a brief overview:

1. Data Overview: Explore the primary census abstract dataset and understand its characteristics.
2. EDA: Conduct detailed Exploratory Data Analysis to gain insights into the data.
3. PCA: Implement Principal Component Analysis (PCA) using Sklearn to identify the most significant Principal Components.
4. Conclusion: Summarize findings and insights obtained from the PCA analysis.

These analyses aim to provide valuable insights and facilitate decision-making in the respective domains.
